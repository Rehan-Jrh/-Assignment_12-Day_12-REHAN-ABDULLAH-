Structured Query Language (SQL) is a standardized programming language that can also be used to access and manipulate relational databases. Users can Create, Read, Update, and Delete (CRUD) data stored in relational databases and also defines and manages the database structure.<br>



When it comes to web development, SQL allows for the storing, retrieving, updating, and deleting of data in a way that provides dynamic and data-driven websites (like user accounts or an online listing of products). MySQL, PostgreSQL, and SQLite are common examples of databases that use SQL.
